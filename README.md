## Rationale behind the Perform, Plan, Program Pi Guides ##
----------
## Introduction ##
- For teachers to plan and teach from (not to give to students)
- PERFORM the process; then PLAN it out; finally PROGRAM the code.
- Linked to Computing Programme of Study
- Linked to Progression Pathways
- Main Computer Science concepts highlighted
- They are not step by step instructions
- Provide some questions you could ask students
- Provide some extension activities for students

## Perform ##
- Kinaesthetic
- Gets concepts over
- Computational Thinking

## Plan ##
- Create flow diagram and/or pseudocode
- Language independent
- Highlights potential issues

## Hardware Setup ##
- Details equipment needed
- Outlines a method
- Provides a diagram

## Program ##
- Sample code for Scratch 1.4 using Scratch GPIO
- Sample code for Python 3
- Code is shown for teachers use don't show students let them work it out

## Extension Tasks ##
- Questions and tasks which could extend student's learning
